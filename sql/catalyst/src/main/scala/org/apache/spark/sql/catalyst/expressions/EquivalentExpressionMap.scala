/**
 * A class that allows you to map an expression into a set of equivalent expressions. The keys are
 * handled based on their semantic meaning and ignoring cosmetic differences. The values are
 * represented as [[ExpressionSet]]s.
 *
 * The underlying representation of keys depends on the [[Expression.semanticHash]] and
 * [[Expression.semanticEquals]] methods.

 *   map.get(1 + 2) => Set(a) // 1 + 2 and 2 + 1 are semantically equivalent
